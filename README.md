# rApexLegends
A repository containing my work during my brief period at /r/ApexLegends, /r/ApexOutlands, and /r/ApexLFG. The repository is sadly bare and minimalistic because a former disgruntled mod team I used to work with decided to reach out and use their "sway" to bully me off the project.

## Contents

### /r/ApexLegends
`r-apexlegends/` contains all of the files related to /r/ApexLegends development.  
`r-apexlegends/apexlegends.css` contains the current base for /r/ApexLegends as of 2/12/2019.  
`r-apexlegends/img/` contains all of the image resources needed for the stylesheet.  

### /r/ApexOutlands
`r-apexlegends/img` contains all of the image resources needed for the stylesheet. The stylesheet has no other differences other than different images.

### /r/ApexLFG
/r/ApexLFG is currently on /r/ApexLegends CSS, images included, so there is nothing to add here.
